# Lateral.run v0.4.0

May 13, 2020

## Changed

- While we were fixing multi-line log output (see below), we decided to make a
  few improvements as well:
  - Logs are now visually grouped by run. This makes it much easier to parse
    when you're logging more than once from your code.
  - The last 50 runs are now listed, instead of just the last 24 hours of logs.

## Fixed

- Multi-line log output (like when you `console.log` an object) is now split and
  indented correctly.
