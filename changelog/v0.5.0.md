# Lateral.run v0.5.0

June 1, 2020

## Changed

- **BREAKING:** The REST API endpoint to run your customer's code has moved the
  `async` option from the query string to the request body, which makes more
  sense for a `POST` request. The data to pass to your customer's code has
  subsequently been moved under the `data` key to keep it separated. We've
  released v0.3.0 of our [Node.js client](https://github.com/lateralrun/node) to
  support this change.
- **BREAKING:** For security reasons, we no longer run install scripts when
  installing Cloud Function dependencies. This isn't an issue for most packages,
  but those that depend on them won't work going forward.
- Saving a Cloud Function is now much faster in most cases, as we're only
  building and deploying the parts that have changed. No dependency changes?
  Skip. Simply enabling/disabling? Instant.
