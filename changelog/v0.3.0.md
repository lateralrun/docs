# Lateral.run v0.3.0

May 11, 2020

## New

- Deleting a Cloud Function in the editor now prompts for confirmation in case
  the button is triggered by accident.

## Changed

- We reduced the size of our unnecessarily bloated CSS from ~1.6 MB to ~30 KB,
  which comes in at ~7 KB gzipped.
- Speaking of gzip, we (accidentally) _weren't_ doing that, and we now are.
- When an async run or deploy fails, we changed the retry delay to 5, 10, 20,
  40, and 80 minutes to give more time for whatever's causing the failure to
  recover.
