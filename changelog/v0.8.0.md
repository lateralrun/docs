# Lateral.run v0.8.0

July 10, 2020

## New

- When an account is deleted from your app, we've documented how to delete the
  account and all associated code/data from Lateral.run as well via API request.
  See [Integration: Backend](../docs/integration_backend.md) for more details.
  If you're using our [Node.js client](https://github.com/lateralrun/node),
  v0.4.0 has a new `deleteAccount` function.
